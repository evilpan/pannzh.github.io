>**我曾七次鄙视自己的灵魂：**  
>
> - 第一次，当她本可进取时，却故作谦卑； 
> - 第二次，她在腿有残疾的人面前，跛行而过；
> - 第三次，在困难和容易之间，她选择了容易 ；
> - 第四次，她犯了错，却借由别人也会犯错来宽慰自己；
> - 第五次，她因为软弱而忍让，却声称为自己的坚韧 ；
> - 第六次，当她鄙夷一张丑恶的嘴脸时，却不知那正是自己面具中的一副； 
> - 第七次，她吟唱了一首赞歌，并自诩为一种美德。

> **Seven times have I despised my soul:**  
>
> - *The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.*
> - *The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.*
> - *The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.*
> - *The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.*
> - *The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.*
> - *The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.*
> - *And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.*
